# HeartFlow (心虫)

**AGI Layer 1 — the Discriminator.**

A pure rule engine that judges whether a statement or an action is right, wrong, safe,
or dangerous — before it reaches a human. **Zero LLM dependency.**

```
46 discrimination dimensions  ×  9-layer pipeline  ×  132 modules  ×  180 MCP tools
```

HeartFlow does not generate. It does not compete with an LLM. It stands between the
LLM and the human, like a pain receptor that says "no" when something is wrong.

| Layer | Capability | Who builds it |
|-------|-----------|---------------|
| 5 | Act | Large labs (robotics) |
| 4 | Generate | Large labs (LLMs) |
| 3 | Reason | Built into models |
| 2 | Remember | Large labs + startups |
| **1** | **Discriminate** | **HeartFlow** |

HeartFlow takes layer 1 because this layer does not depend on compute, code volume,
or framework ecosystems. It depends on judgment alone.

## Install

Requires **Node.js >= 18.17**. No GPU, no database, no API key, no network at runtime,
no runtime dependencies.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yun520-1/mark-heartflow-skill.git
cd mark-heartflow-skill
node bin/verify.js        # 14 installation checks
node bin/cli.js status    # engine status
node bin/cli.js chat      # interactive console
```

Or through npm:

```bash
npm install @yun520-1/heartflow
```

---

## Use it in 30 seconds

```javascript
const gate = require('./src/gate.js');

const r = gate.checkOutput('According to 2025 Harvard research, coffee extends life by 12.5 years');

console.log(r.gate.action);   // 'verify'  -> gather evidence before believing this
console.log(r.verdict);       // '需验证'
console.log(r.findings[0]);   // { dimension: 'unsupported_claim', severity: 90, guidance: '...' }
```

Four possible actions:

| Action | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `pass` | Clean. Deliver normally. |
| `verify` | Needs evidence. Run the verifier first. |
| `rewrite` | Must be rewritten. Follow `findings[].guidance`. |
| `block` | Stop. Do not output. Use `gate.reason`. |

`verdict` is derived from `gate.action`, so the two never contradict each other.

---

## The three entry points

| Function | Use it for | What it adds |
|----------|-----------|--------------|
| `checkInput(text)` | User input, before processing | scope-check, premise-check, 46 dimensions, error memory |
| `checkDraft(text)` | An AI draft, before completion | the above + frame-check + doubt-engine |
| `checkOutput(text)` | An AI response, before sending | the above + output-gate + doubt-engine |
| `runPipeline({ input, mode, anchor })` | Full pipeline with mode and conversation anchor | keeps the model on the original goal across long sessions |

---

## Architecture

```
input
  |
  v
scope-check -> premise-check -> discriminate (46 dimensions) -> gate
                                                                   |
  +----------------------------------------------------------------+
  v
evidence verify -> frame-check -> output-gate -> doubt-engine
  |
  v
intent-anchor -> rewriter -> error-memory -> self-diagnosis -> output
```

The gate aggregates findings from every layer and emits a single action:
`block` / `rewrite` / `verify` / `pass`.

### Capability domains (7 domains, 132 modules)

| Domain | Representative modules |

| Logic | logicReasoning, judgmentEngine, debateConductor, counterfactualVerifier |
| Decision | decisionRouter, decisionVerifier, activeInference, selfHealing |
| Cognition | cognitiveEngine, cognitiveLoad, metacognitiveRL, sustainedDriftDetector |
| Emotion / psychology | emotion, psychology, empathyDeepening, griefEngine, traumaInformed |
| Memory | memory, memoryBank, memoryIntegrity, forgetting, knowledgeGraph |
| Identity / ethics | identityCore, personaCore, virtueEthics, moralDevelopment, meaningPurpose |
| Creation / collaboration | skillEvolution, worldModel, multiAgentDialogue, codeExecutor, formula |

## MCP server

HeartFlow exposes its engine as an MCP server, so any MCP-capable agent can call it.

```bash
node src/mcp-server.js --port 8588
```

Then connect:

```bash
hermes mcp add heartflow --url http://localhost:8588/mcp
```

The server authenticates with a bearer token generated on first start and written to
`.env` (never committed). A request without a valid token returns `401`.

---

## Tests

```bash
node test/run-all.js          # full suite (recursive over test/, including subdirectories)
node bin/verify.js            # installation checks
```

`test/run-all.js` walks `test/` recursively, so tests in `test/core/`, `test/memory/`,
`test/utils/`, and other subdirectories run alongside the top-level files.

---

## Honest limitations

**It is:** the discrimination layer of AGI — a rule engine judging right and wrong,
good and bad, safe and dangerous.

**It is not:** AGI itself, a generative model, a semantic understanding system
(irony and metaphor are invisible to it), a substitute for content moderation, or a
safety certification.

Known limits:

1. Pattern-matching ceiling — new tricks require new patterns.
2. Bilingual maintenance cost across all dimensions.
3. No semantic understanding — irony, metaphor, and cultural context are invisible.
4. False-positive rate around 8% at baseline.
5. Single maintainer.
6. Chinese tokenisation is heuristic (greedy longest-match with a stopword list, not a
   full dictionary), so unusual phrasings can segment imperfectly.
